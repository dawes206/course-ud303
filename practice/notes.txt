Working on figuring out response/request format


So, createing a server to test the send_header stuff.
Ran it with py
Connected to it with ncat 127.0.0.1 8000
Sent it a GET request. No other headers.
Server sent a response that included all the headers I wanted to send. GREAT!



Trying to create a server from "scratch" to send hello in response body
Use ncat -l and ncat hostname to communicate and formulate what I need to send

It worked!



Super annoying. For some reason, now ncat 127.0.0.1 8000 isn't working. It'll work on other ports, but not this one. I think this is because the poret may be "filled up". But definitely extremely obnoxious

I was trying to send self.path in the request body. I was able to send a hello message no problem. Assuming self.path is the variable I need, it should send no problem.
IT WORKED! And self.path was the variable I needed. Once 8000 was "cleared" no problems.
Now I can continue on ECHO SERVER lesson
