Working on figuring out response/request format


So, createing a server to test the send_header stuff.
Ran it with py
Connected to it with ncat 127.0.0.1 8000
Sent it a GET request. No other headers.
Server sent a response that included all the headers I wanted to send. GREAT!



Trying to create a server from "scratch" to send hello in response body
Use ncat -l and ncat hostname to communicate and formulate what I need to send

It worked!



Super annoying. For some reason, now ncat 127.0.0.1 8000 isn't working. It'll work on other ports, but not this one. I think this is because the poret may be "filled up". But definitely extremely obnoxious
